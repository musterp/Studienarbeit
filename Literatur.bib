    abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE

    In the Western world, there are at least 20-30 million people with tattoos. Improved self-image and social stigmatization are the main reasons for removing tattoos from skin. Q-switched lasers are applied to destroy the tattoo compounds in the skin. The treatment of tattoos containing ink often gives excellent results, whereas the results of treatments for coloured tattoos are not predictable and usually are worse. The chemical structure and the absorption spectra of the tattoo pigments are usually unknown. However, the efficacy of the treatment by using light of different Q-switched lasers (wavelengths 510, 532, 694, 755, 1064 nm) is correlated to both the chemical structure of the tattooed compounds yielding specific absorption spectra and the laser wavelength used.

    STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS

    A structural and spectroscopic analysis of 41 coloured pigments was performed.

    RESULTS

    The 41 substances were identified, and they consist of 16 i},

    abstract = {Organic dyes and pigments constitute a large class of industrial products. The utilization of these compounds in the field of organic electronics is reviewed with particular emphasis on organic field-effect transistors. It is shown that for most major classes of industrial dyes and pigments, i.e., phthalocyanines, perylene and naphthalene diimides, diketopyrrolopyrroles, indigos and isoindigos, squaraines, and merocyanines, charge-carrier mobilities exceeding 1 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) have been achieved. The most widely investigated molecules due to their n-channel operation are perylene and naphthalene diimides, for which even values close to 10 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) have been demonstrated. The fact that all of these \textgreek{p}-conjugated colorants contain polar substituents leading to strongly quadrupolar or even dipolar molecules suggests that indeed a much larger structural space shows promise for the design of organic semiconductor molecules than was considered in this field traditionall},

Yet, until now, there have been no independent expert guides or tutorials to supplement the various BSIM manuals currently available. Written by a noted expert in the field, this book fills that gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive guide to understanding and making optimal use of BSIM3 and BSIM4. Drawing upon his extensive experience designing with BSIM, William Liu provides a brief history of the model, discusses the various advantages of BSIM over other models, and explores the reasons why BSIM3 has been adopted by the majority of circuit manufacturers.

Furthermore, it is challenging to develop a universal model that would cover a huge variety of materials and device structures available for state-of-the-art OFETs. Nonetheless, currently there is a strong need for specific OFET compact models when device-to-system integration is an important issue. We briefly describe the most fundamental characters of organic semiconductors and OFETs, which set the bottom line dictating the requirement of an original model different from that of conventional inorganic devices. Along with an introduction to the principles of compact modeling for circuit simulation, a comparative analysis of the reported models is presented with an emphasis on their primary assumptions and applicability aspects. Critical points for advancing OFET compact models are discussed in consideration of the recent understanding of device physics.},

Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of flexible poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) field-effect transistors (FETs) on cellulose paper with biopolymer chitosan smoothing layers and efficient reusable ion gel gate dielectrics. The high specific capacitance of ion gels led to the formation of an electric-double-layer (EDL) at the channel/dielectric interface that plays a critical role in modulating the currents of the devices. Reasonable electrical characteristics and mechanical flexibility were observed. Transistors with an operating voltage as low as 2 V, a source drain current of up to [similar]1 mA, a current on/off ratio of 3-4 orders of magnitude and a large field-effect mobility of [similar]0.97 cm2 V-1 s-1 have been obtained. Especially, the laminated ion gels can be in situ peeled off and reused in other FETs and the device performance is not degenerated obviously with repeated use. The unique flexibility of the FETs on paper with reusable ion gel dielectrics manifests their applications as the next generation of throwaway electronics.},

Printed electronic circuits using organic resistors, diodes and transistors may become cheap alternatives to silicon-based systems, especially in large-area applications. A key parameter for device operation, besides long term stability, is the reproducibility of the current-voltage behavior, which may be affected by hysteresis phenomena. Hysteresis effects are often observed in organic transistors during sweeps of the gate voltage (VGS). This hysteresis can originate in various ways, but comparative scientific investigations are rare and a comprehensive picture of "hysteresis phenomena'' in OFETs is still missing. This review provides an overview of the physical effects that cause hysteresis and discusses the importance of such effects in OFETs in a comparative manner.},

Curing conditions of spin-cast PVP influence on the drain current-gate bias hysteresis behavior; long term curing reduces the magnitude of the hysteresis, which can also be reduced by decreasing the PVP thickness. The electron charge injection from gate electrode plays as another cause of the electrical hysteresis. These instabilities are categorized into the following three: channel/dielectric interface-induced, slow polarization-induced, and gate charge injection-induced hystereses. By examining the hysteresis behavior of pentacene TFTs with five different combinations of bilayer dielectric, we clarified the instability mechanisms responsible for the electrical hysteresis.

The electrical characteristics and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements show that hysteresis is intimately related to the presence of free OH groups in the polymer gate dielectrics. The methyl methacryl moieties in PVP-PMMA minimize residual water in the polymer and form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups, thus reducing the number of free OH species. Therefore, pentacene FETs and inverters using PVP-PMMA gate dielectrics exhibit high, hysteresis-free performances.},

Although electronic devices have brought much convenience and value, the insatiable appetite for newer and more attractive devices has also created a growing ecological problem: managing electronic waste or e-waste. As the lifetime of electronic devices gets shorter and shorter, the pressure on e-waste management systems is mounting with no abate in sight. Therefore, an alternative to traditional electronics must be sought. Bio-degradable electronics have thus emerged as the most viable and ideal replacement to address the issue of uncontrollable e-waste. Bio-degradability will ensure that the waste generated will be at least non-toxic and even environmentally friendly. Furthermore, bio-degradable organic materials have also been shown to be biocompatible and human-friendly, being able to be metabolized safely in the body without causing adverse physiological reactions. As such, this developing class of “green” electronics is not only able to alleviate the growing e-waste problem, but also fulfils niche applications interfacing with the human body. This Review will introduce various bio-degradable organic materials that can serve as substitutes for the different components of an electronic device, highlight recent research achievements and applications in implementing such bio-degradable devices as well as present an overview of the printing technologies available that provide the low-cost and high throughput advantages of solution-processable organic materials over the traditional inorganic materials.},

We evaluated dyes from the following chemical families: acridones, anthraquinones, carotenoids, and indigoids. These materials have proven effective in organic field effect transistors, with mobilities in the 4 × 10-4 - 0.2 cm2/V-s range, with indigoids showing promising ambipolar behavior. We fabricated complementary-like voltage inverters with high gains using indigoids. The photovoltaic properties of these materials were characterized in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diodes, as well as in donoracceptor bilayer devices. Additionally, we have found that indigoids and Quinacridone, show long-range crystalline order due to hydrogen binding, and have considerably higher relative permittivities ($\epsilon$) compared to typical organic semiconductors. Higher permittivities result in lower exciton binding energies and thus may lead to high photocurrents in photovoltaic devices.},

Unlike pentacene, quinacridone has limited intramolecular $\pi$-conjugation and becomes highly colored in the solid state due to strong intermolecular electronic coupling. We found that quinacridone shows a field-effect mobility of 0.1 cm2/Vs, comparable to mobilities of pentacene in similarly prepared devices. Photoinduced charge generation in single-layer quinacridone metal-insulator-metal diodes is more than a hundred times more efficient than in pentacene devices. Photoinduced charge transfer from quinacridone to C60 is not effective, as evidenced by measurements in heterojunctions with C60.
